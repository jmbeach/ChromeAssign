#ChromeAssign
Google Chrome extension which aims to make using WebAssign easier.

##Features
As of right now the only feature is generating a page of "Practice Another Version" problems for every problem which is available. This page can be printed out and saves time when reviewing an old webassign. 

##Install
1. clone the repo anywhere you'd like.
2. Open your chrome extensions, go into "Developer mode" and click "Load unpacked extension..."
3. Select the directory where you cloned the repo.

##Usage
### Generate Practice Problems
Open a WebAssign assignment page and click the app icon. [here's what I mean](http://i.imgur.com/P7WDck6.png?1)
A page should open up that has all available "Practice Another Version" problems on it.
